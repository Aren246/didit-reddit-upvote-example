Here is my reflection on this weeks assignment. For this weeks assignment I noted down on paper my reflections as a devlog. This is the first time using this method and I think I will be continuing with this for future projects. I've noted mistakes down before but not step by step actions that were done to complete the assignment

## Dev log

1. Deployed on Vercel  to see errors & bugs.
2. Created tables in Supabase that were provided
3. Uncommented the UNIQUE_ID
4. Created an .env file
5. Did npm i and installed packages needed
6. Ran npm run dev to see errors in console
7. Added Supabase transaction code
8. Added OAuth Git Keys to .env
9. Added variables to Vercel
10. Deployed successful after changing .env
11. Issues with the log-in - wasnt able to understand why. I changed the github url to the vercel url and still recieved error. Added screenshot of error page to submission.
12. Made Dynamic Metadata - only bit of coding to commit and push.
